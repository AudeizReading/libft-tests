libft-test
==========

This applies to the new libft.

For using this program, you need this arborescence:

```shell
.
|- libft
|- libft-test
```
 
Like that, you don't need to change the path for including libft

### For using libft-test:

Go into the libft-test directory and do:

 ```Makefile
 make test
 ```
It will compile the libft *(not bonus yet)* and launch the executable that testing
your libft, but you have to respect the mentionned arborescence.

That's all folks for the moment.
*Pay attention, because this test is incomplete, I will update it gradually*
