# trying-libft
For using this file, you need this arborescence:

. | - libft

  | - trying-libft
 
Like that, you don't need to change the path for including libft

For using trying-libft:
Go in the trying-libft directory and do:
 ```
 gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -L ../libft -lft main.c
 ./a.out lalali
 ```
 
That's all folks for the moment
