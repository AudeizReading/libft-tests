# trying-libft
For using this file, you need this arborescence:

.

| - libft

| - trying-libft
 
Like that, you don't need to change the path for including libft

For using trying-libft:
Go into the trying-libft directory and do:

 ```Makefile
 make test
 ```
It will compile the libft *(not bonus yet)* and launch the executable that testing
your libft, but you have to respect the mentionned arborescence.

That's all folks for the moment.
*Pay attention, because this test is incomplete, I will update it gradually*
